1. Write a program which will read temperature
value in Fahrenheit scale and print the value in Celsius scale.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int f,c;
    cout<<" enter the  value of fahrenheit :";
    cin>>f;
    c = (f -32)*5/9;
    cout<<" conversion of fahrenheit to celsuis : "<<c<<"celsius";

   }
2. Write a program to enter length and width of a
rectangle and find area and perimeter of the rectangle.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int l,b,area,per;
    cout<<"enter the length :";
    cin>>l;
     cout<<"enter the breadth :";
    cin>>b;
    area = l*b;
    per = 2*(l+b);
    cout<<"area :"<<area<<" per :"<<per;
}



3.Write a program to enter marks of five
subjects of a student and calculate total, average and percentage of all
subjects.
 #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    float marks[5];
    
    cout << "Enter marks for five subjects:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        cout << "Subject " << i + 1 << ": ";
        cin >> marks[i];
    }

    
    float total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        total += marks[i];
    }

   
    float average = total / 5;

    float percentage = (total / 500) * 100;

   
    cout << "\nResults:" << endl;
    cout << "Total Marks: " << total << endl;
    cout << "Average Marks: " << average << endl;
    cout << "Percentage: " << percentage << "%" << endl;

    return 0;
}


4.Write four statements by using printf function
to print an asterisk pattern having 1, 3,5 and 7 asterisks (*) in successive
lines so that it generates a triangular pattern as given below.
        *
     * *  *
   * * * * *
 * * * * * * *

Sources code:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int height = 4;  

    for (int i = 0; i < height; ++i) {
       
        for (int j = 0; j < height - i - 1; ++j) {
            cout << " ";
        }
  
        for (int k = 0; k < 2 * i + 1; ++k) {
            cout << "*";
        }

        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}



5. A ball is released
from a height of Y meters. Each time it bounces on the floor, its velocity
becomes halved. Write a program, which reads the value of Y and prints the total
distance traversed by the ball when it touches the ground for the third time. Assume
that the value of acceleration due to gravity, g, is 9.8.
Sources code:
#include <iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   
    const double g = 9.8; 
    double initialHeight;
    cout << "Enter the initial height (in meters): ";
    cin >> initialHeight;
    double totalDistance = 0;
    for (int bounce = 1; bounce <= 3; ++bounce) {
        
        double timeToGround = sqrt(2 * initialHeight / g);

    
        double distanceCovered = 0.5 * g * (timeToGround * timeToGround);

        
        totalDistance += distanceCovered;

       
        initialHeight /= 2;
    }

    
    cout << "Total distance traversed by the ball after 3 bounces: " << totalDistance << " meters" << endl;

    return 0;
}


6. Consider a bank that offers fixed deposit
accounts with cumulative (annually) interest on the balance available in the
account. Write a C program that reads the amount initially invested (called
Principal amount) in an account and interest rate. The program generates the balance
available in the account at the end of each year for first five years.
Sourcecode:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double principalAmount, interestRate, balance;

    cout << "Enter the principal amount: ";
    cin >> principalAmount;

    cout << "Enter the interest rate (in percentage): ";
    cin >> interestRate;

    interestRate /= 100;

    cout << "\nYear\tBalance\n";

  
    for (int year = 1; year <= 5; ++year) {
        
        balance = principalAmount * (1 + interestRate);

      
        cout << year << "\t" << balance << endl;

      
        principalAmount = balance;
    }

    return 0;
}
